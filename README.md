The project is a simple React application that allows users to add and remove products and search for products based on their name, id or price. The application consists of components, which includes a product list, a header, a footer and an add product modal.

The main logic of the application is in the App component. This component maintains the state of the product list and renders the other components. The product list component is responsible for displaying the list of products, and the add product modal appears when the user clicks the "Add Product" button.

The product data is stored in an array of product objects. Each product object contains an id, a name, a price and an image URL. The id is a number, while the name and image URL are strings, and the price is a number with two decimal places.

The user can search for products by entering a search query in the search input field. The application filters the product list based on the search query and displays only the matching products.

The user can add a new product by clicking the "Add Product" button and filling out the input in the add product modal. When the user submits, the application adds a new product object to the product list.

Finally, the user can remove a product from the list by clicking the "Remove" in the product list.
